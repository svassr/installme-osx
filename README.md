# My personal scripts to setup a new OSX

These are just my personal scripts to help me setup a new osx machine.

To start a new setup, simply run:

```shell
bash -c "`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svassr/installme-osx/master/setup.sh`"
```

## Complete setup

Setting up a new osx machine requires some manual steps, [a gist enumerating all these steps is available here](https://gist.github.com/ruyadorno/d14d399b1853b29b08c8).
